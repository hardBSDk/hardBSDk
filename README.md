## History

I met Linux in school during computing classes, we played Tux Math on Linux Mint, in 2012 I installed Debian for the first time in hope to recover my Windows 7 password (I remembered it after Debian install, lol), later in 2013 I tested Ubuntu but dropped due to bad Wine compatibility with games, then in 2015 I came back to Ubuntu as my dual boot system with Windows 8.1, then I tested Solus, Fedora, FreeBSD Void Linux, ReactOS, Haiku and others.

After 2018, Linux became my main system.
